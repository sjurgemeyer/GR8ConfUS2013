				<section>
					<h2>A little about what we did</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>8 In-House Plugins (some dependent on others)</li>
						<li>3 Core Applications (one consumer-facing, two internal)</li>
						<li>LOTS of testing overhaul</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Chime in!</h2>
					<p>Many of you have done this, share your knowledge</p>
				</section>


				<section>
					<h1>Brief Intro: Why are we doing this again?</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						This talk isn't strictly about why to upgrade, every project will be different and it's up to you to decide if what you're getting is worth it.
						With that said, it's important to know why we're doing this before we start, so we can convince stakeholders to commit resources to it.

						<h2>Grails 2.X</h2>
						<p>(Well duh)</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div data-markdown>
						[What's new in Grails 2.0 and above](http://grails.org/doc/2.3.x/guide/introduction.html#whatsNew)
						</div>
						<aside class="notes">
							Spend some time on this site,
							But not too much time.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Testability</h2>
						<p>This would be a primary reason to upgrade.</p>
						<p>Grails 2 introduced a *lot* of excellent testing support, including...</p>
						<ul>
							<li>In memory GORM (making unit testing criteria Queries possible)</li>
							<li>Better Console Output</li>
							<li>Cleaner test reports</li>	
							<li>Annotation based mocking makes code more straight-forward (imho)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Support</h2>
						<p>Since much of the community is moving forward with Grails 2, it will be easier to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Get StackOverflow questions answered</li>
							<li>Get a new feature in a plugin</li>
							<li>Find talented developers familiar with your technology</li>
							<li>Etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>And More!</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Groovy 1.8 support (or 2.0 in Grails 2.2+)</li>
							<li>ORM improvements and more options (mongoDB for example)</li>
							<li>Better default scaffolding (jQuery and HTML5)</li>
							<li>Easier date parsing</li>
							<li>Multiple Data Sources Support</li>
							<li>Etc etc etc (read the docs, yo!)</li>

					<h1>PREPARING TO UPGRADE: Bring the right tools</h1>

							For those who don't know, this is Fix-it Felix, he's from the Disney movie Wreck It Ralph (told you I was a Disney-phile) and his motto is:

							Highly recommended for doing side-by-side upgrade, free trial period may be all you need but when you need it, its an invaluable tool.
							Also on the radar Araxis Merge (http://www.araxis.com/merge/)

						<h2>GVM</h2>
						<p>Lets you jump between versions with ease</p>
						<code>gvm install grails [version]</code>

							Ask who's using it, recommend to do so if you aren't already.

						<h2>Source Control</h2>
						<p>Know how to hop around and make incremental progress!</p>
						<p>Git, Mercurial, maybe SVN</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Mention Git as front-end for SVN but then maybe slightly harder to work together on branch, all the more reason to commit to this as fully as possible.
							Don't know much about different VCS so whatever it is know it well.

						<h2>UNIT TESTS</h2>
						<img src="assets/GoldenHammer.jpg" height="500" width="400">
						<aside class="notes">
							A good set of unit tests already surrounding your code is going to be necessary! Shore 'em up before you start!

						<code>grails upgrade</code> 
						<h2>is dead to you!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Can't stress this enough, it will save a lot of time to ignore grails upgrade and work side-by-side
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Get the tests passing first</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							This isn't the only thing you'll need to do, but it helps to take the upgrade one app at a time, one plugin at a time, one test at a time.
							That or you can blanket sweep for certain classes of general problems and work through it that way, your call.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h3>note: that will take awhile</h3>
						<img src="assets/zan-tweet-dependencies1.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							Don't expect to be done easy breezy.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Fire it up!</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Good unit testing will make this less painful, but ultimately you need to run things and try them out to find the outlying issues your tests perhaps weren't covering.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Merging Back</h2>
						<img src="assets/side-by-side-upgrade.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							Note that you may need to change your project name if you do this literally side by side.
							Be familiar with your tools when you do this.

						<p>The redirect() method now uses the grails.serverURL config setting<p>

								This bit me on a side project where I deploy to a test environment and production, but didn't have a good build process to define these.
								Just another example of good software practices and their benefits.
							</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Public methods in controllers will now be treated as actions. If you don't want this, make them protected or private.<p>
							<aside class="notes">
								Wasn't really an issue for us, but I came across blog entries where this would be a fairly concerning security risk. Be mindful.
							</aside>

					<section>
						<p>ConfigurationHolder.config -> grailsApplication.config<p>
							<aside class="notes">
								ConfigHolder is now deprecated, this one is just a bit tedious to change but quite straight-forward.

					<h2>Testing - A new world order</h2>

					<h1>Takeaway Points</h1>
				</section>

				<section>
					<!-- Vertical Section -->
					<section>
						<h2>TAKE YOUR TIME</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is a conversation to have with the business leaders. 
							Be honest that this is a dedication to key resources, but do your best to explain the risks in staying behind, the productivity and recruiting benefits to upgrading. 
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Try to keep new feature development to a minimum</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Again, explain to your stakeholders that while you know there are needs to add functionality, this is a time to keep that to an absolute minimum.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Do a back-merge all at once, right before finishing. Communicate with your team!</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							We made the mistake of trying to periodically re-base with development. This is a very bad idea as it makes it near-impossible to track what's different between your side-by-side changes on purpose and what's creeping in from new features.
							Finish your upgrade work, rebase and fix up what needs upgrading of the new features, and move quickly to merge back!
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>Take a look for existing docs on how upgrade problems were solved...</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							It may seem like slim pickings at first, but there actually is a fair bit out there. Be patient and flex your search-fu.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>... but know that some problems will be unique to your codebase.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							You also can't expect everyone to have encountered everything. Like my example of the structured properties or Zan's unit test in the integration folder, crazy things can come out of the woodwork.
							Have confidence, be like Felix, say "I can fix it!"
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Don't fear the source, love the source.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Obviously like me you don't want to get so wrapped up in knowing the answer that you delay your upgrade any longer, but be comfortable with the source code.
							Debug through it, learn more about why your probelm is happening, and act accordingly.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>If all else fails, ask the community if you get stuck!</p>
						<img src="assets/zan-tweet-dependencies2.png">
						<aside class="notes">
							We have the benefit of a wonderful community of talented developers, don't abuse their kindness but don't be shy to ask for a hand here and there either!
							If you've done your due diligence, people may even enjoy helping :)
